## Project Structure

- `ansible.cfg`: Configuration file for Ansible.
- `hosts.ini`: Inventory file containing the AWS instances.
- `ansible.yaml`: Ansible playbook that defines the tasks to be executed on the AWS instances.
- `README.md`: Documentation of steps

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the playbook, ensure you have the following:

- Python
- Pipx
- Dependencies

## Installation

[Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-and-upgrading-ansible-with-pipx)

1. **Install Ansible** on your control machine. You can install it using:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   pipx install --include-deps ansible
   pipx install ansible-core
   pipx install ansible-core==2.12.3
   ```

2. **Access your AWS instances** via SSH. Make sure you have the `labsuser.pem` key file and it's properly configured:
   ```bash
   cd Downloads/
   sudo chmod 400 ./labsuser.pem
   ssh -i ./labsuser.pem "name_of_aws_instance"
   ```

## Running the Playbook

To run the playbook, execute the following command:

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini ansible.yaml
```

then we can open our application from the DNS of AWS machines with port `8000`
